# change-background-with-opencv
This repossitory performs several image processing operations using the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries. 
Image Processing Code
This repository contains code for performing various image processing operations using the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries. The code is written in Python and demonstrates how to read, manipulate, and merge images.

Features
Read and display an image using OpenCV
Resize an image to match another image's dimensions
Convert color space from BGR to RGB
Create a mask based on color thresholds
Apply a mask to an image to hide or reveal specific regions
Merge two images by combining their pixels

Dependencies
The code relies on the following libraries:

OpenCV: Provides image reading, resizing, color space conversion, and other image processing functions.
Matplotlib: Used for displaying images and plots.
Please make sure to install these libraries before running the code.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please submit a pull request. Any help in expanding the functionality or adding new features is highly appreciated.

Acknowledgments
This code was developed as a learning exercise and can serve as a starting point for understanding and implementing basic image processing techniques. Special thanks to the creators and contributors of the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries for their invaluable work.
